Archegos collapse has been fascinating and reminded many market partcipants the echoes of Long Term Capital Management. 
How did one faimly office cause multiple prime brokerages to lose billions of dollars? Where were the compliance and risk
management officers? Worse, did the compliance officers and risk management officers get overriden because someone in leadership
wanted a lucrative client?

1. For a prime brokerage, is the collateral sufficient to offset the downside risk? The securities in question 
may have varying degree of liquidity. However, once the position is sufficiently large, the projected value may break down. 
In the event of 100 million shares of a particuar security, the sequence of a fire sale will affect the collateral value. 
What's the risk to reward ratio? If the fees generated by margin trade for the brokerage 
is only tens of million dollars, the potential to lose upward of 2 billion dollars seem like a terrible risk-adjusted-return. 

2. The concentrated bets on these securities is masked by the use of total return swap. This skirts the disclosure requirement
when a firm has an outsize (10%?) of economic interest of a publicly traded company. As we hae seen from 2008 financial melt down
with derivaties like collaterilize-debt-olligtation (CDO) and credit-default-swap (CDS). These opaque derivatives allow large amount
of risks remained undetected from the regulators. 

3. Archegos did not cause a system risk like Long Term Capital Management because Archegos only have few concentrated bets.
However, with this much liquidity in the market, it does not require much imagination that someone with the same amount of
risk appetite can accumulate a large amount of counter party risks via deriatives and blow up the financial market again.
